 I found this one tricky. 

Without touching the markup, I've tried to alter the layout on scroll by heavily leveraging `calc()` and css variables ðŸ¤¯

This would have to be adjusted if the content was altered. The moving title etc. rely on `position: fixed` and transforms based on their `font-size`.

But it is responsive! 

Enjoy!
